The Akans highly value the virtue of humility. There are constant reminders of the transience of life and modesty in attire and way of living. One of these reminders is the adinkra symbol Owuo Atwedee. Everyone will eventually climb the ladder of death, so the proverb goes. It serves as a reminder that no matter how strong and capable a person is, death is unavoidable. Death is no longer an obstacle for us because we have triumphed over it with all of our potion inventions. At least one force, which we can refer to as nature, God, or whatever, is at work in human events and ultimately triumphs. Having this in mind while you organise your life and activities is what it means to be modest.

It is not easy for everyone to be modest in the face of prosperity and good fortune. Maybe this stems from the belief that one is responsible for everything that occurs in their lives. There exist those who maintain that the affluent's wealth and the impoverished's poverty are only due to their individual endeavours. In light of this line of reasoning, it is acceptable to feel proud of oneself for accomplishments and to hold others less fortunate in high regard. If one's overall merit is demonstrated by their success and undermined by their failure, then the wealthy and influential have a right to respond to their good fortune with excessive superciliousness. Is this accurate?

Since the image is essentially a depiction of two opposing horns, it displays vertical symmetry. When rams battle, their horns face in that direction. As they move apart and then sprint at one another at high speed to slam their horns against one another, the scene may be incredibly captivating. It seems like it could be somewhat terrifying for one of them, if not both of them. These ordinarily modest creatures feel that they must harm themselves if necessary to illustrate a point in an effort to gain control and authority. To whom, though? Animals regularly exhibit this primal drive in public, and humans haven't shown themselves to be much better. We desire respect.

We desire recognition. Our want is to be loved. In the event that it does not occur, we aim to demonstrate the error of those who prevented it. Even though this demonstration can occasionally be extremely expensive, we still think it is vital. Maybe we should look at things from a different angle. Maybe an even greater aim would be to be able to control oneself—that is, to be able to control oneself when provoked.

Fihankra is a compound dwelling that is secured or enclosed. It represents unity, safety, security, completion, and fraternity. Fihankra's etymology combines the Akan words for "house," fi(e), and "circle," hankra. Hence, the precise translation of "fihankra" is "house circle," or a "circular house." This kind of home is designed with rooms or smaller homes grouped around a central courtyard. Compound houses are the name for this kind of home, which is still rather widespread in some areas of Ghana.

Among the Akans, communal living is the norm. The saying "It takes a village to raise a child" is valid in both literal and metaphorical senses. The fundamental idea is that all people share a common humanity. Banishment was once the harshest penalty for a member of society who had transgressed. "Twa no asu" means "Cast him across the river," to put it simply. That would be isolating the individual and openly denouncing his behaviour in an effort to discourage others.

There is a price for safety and security, and each citizen needs to be prepared to pay his share from birth. The compound house has a single entrance and exit, ensuring that the movements of its members are visible to the public. Because there is a social check on people's behaviour, this makes it easier for each member of the home to socialise and integrate into the family and, consequently, the larger society.

People cannot move from one place to another without running into someone else, hence this architecture also guarantees interaction.

Additionally, it lowers the likelihood of breaches because the one vulnerable point can be well secured. Furthermore, the household benefits from the safety in numbers. If you reside in a typical compound house, you are unlikely to be attacked or robbed because there is always someone to help you. You won't go hungry if you're a contributing member of society.

A kind of woven fabric known for its excellence is called nsaa. According to the Akan proverb "Nea onnim nsaa na oto n'ago," which means "he who does not know quality nsaa will buy the fakes," this symbol represents excellence, genuineness, and authenticity.

Craftsmanship is a necessary skill for weaving textiles. The ancient ways of weaving include a tedious process of connecting yarns together thread by thread to make tiny strips that are subsequently sewed together, whether the fabric is Kente or another type. Although we can now produce large-scale imitations of real woven fabrics thanks to modern technology, their worth is still inferior to that of the original fabric. The fabric's value is increased by the human labour that went into making it. It demonstrates a respect for the cloth's originality, craftsmanship, effort, and thinking. It validates the unspoken understanding that the author and the client have similar likes and moral principles.

Saying that God will not die in order for me to die is saying that the only way I can pass away is if God passes away. However, since God is eternal, this implies that I am likewise incapable of passing away.

The seeming incoherence of this remark makes it intriguing. What good is it to claim dominion over death when we are all doomed to die and, worse, do not appear to have any control over the forces that mediate our demise?

Since Adinkra were created only a few centuries ago, it's likely that the Gospel had an influence on this, but even in that case, the creators should be given credit for imbuing their message with unique meaning.

Similar to how Paul states in one of his epistles that a Christian's life is hidden with God in Christ, Generations of intellectuals have long been preoccupied with the search for immortality, but this confession adds a religious component to it. Since God cannot pass away, neither can I. He cannot die primarily because of God's might and unquestionable rule over the creation, not because of his own ability to survive.

Because its founder believes in what the symbol stands for—a prayer for continuity and improvement in what we started, a request for God to defend us when we are unable to defend ourselves—Regent University College of Science and Technology chose to include it in its logo.

The fundamental element of all relationships is love, in all of its nuances. Relationships can hardly make it through without it, let alone flourish. The Akans acknowledge and celebrate sensual love between men and women because they live in a polygamous culture.

This term conveys the belief that if one has pure motives, they will inevitably reach their intended goal. It's possible that one is unsure of the precise steps needed to go to the destination.

This should not serve as a justification for laziness, apathy, or failure to take action in support of deserving causes. It is not immediately clear why the cosmos has a tendency to reward diligent work with favourable results; this is a notion that has to be explained.

The literal meaning of the Ghanaian Twi phrase "Sankofa" is "Go back and get it!" In actuality, it is a combination of the two terms found in the Akan imperative second-person phrase "San kɔfa!"

The Akan proverb that goes with it is "Se wo were fi na wosan kofa a yenkyiri." In other words, it's OK to go back and get whatever you forgot. Translated more literally, it says there's nothing wrong with it if you forget and go back to grab it.

SANKOFA IS A WARNING AGAINST CONCEIT.

Because the experiences and events that gave rise to established customs and traditions would have long since passed from the collective awareness, future generations may become so conceited as to disregard them. Many Akan conventions and aphorisms reiterate that this is a serious mistake that need to be avoided.

The Adinkra symbol known as sankofa represents the attitude and spirit of respect for the past, history, one's elders, and one's ancestors. The fabled bird, straining its neck to retrieve the abandoned yet priceless egg, represents the dedication needed to give the past the respect it deserves in the present by giving it the attention it deserves. Sankofa is a subtle reminder that when we return to our senses, we should have the humility to go back and make apologies if, in our haughtiness, we fail to recognise the treasures of the past.

THE STYLIZED HEART AND THE LEGENDARY SANKOFA BIRD ARE THE TWO EMBLEMS OF SANKOFA.

Two distinct symbols are used to symbolise Sankofa. The bird with the twisted neck is the most well-known, but there is also another one that resembles the traditional heart sign. This figure has two spirals, one at the top and one at the bottom, and is symmetrical around a vertical axis. The spirals most likely symbolise the notion of circling back to a point, which is most likely the source.

THE SIGNIFICANCE OF SANKOFA TO AFRICANS IN THE DIASPORA

African Americans, Africans living in the Caribbean, and all those who were enslaved and ended up abroad frequently yearn to return to their African roots. Spiritual searches for connection and significance are sparked by this innate need, and these searches often pass via indigenous African spirituality, art, and culture—all of which use symbols. Because of this, many Africans living abroad have come to use Sankofa as a totem as they look for and investigate their ancestry. This is appropriate because, just as those who are ignorant of history are destined to repeat it, so too are those who are ignorant of their own ancestry bound to ignorance and the repetition of the errors made by their forebears.

Every call to remember the past is met with opposition regarding the glaring shortcomings and transgressions of earlier eras. This is particularly true in the case of African enslavement, when the great majority (about 90%) were sold into slavery by their own relatives. To learn from the performers, though, we do not have to deify them. We also don't have to erase their transgressions from history or sanitise their legacies. It is enough to acknowledge their pasts for what they are—flawed, blind, and wrong—and work towards improving upon them. We have an obligation to separate the valuable lessons for the modern day from the rest.
